# import shutil

# shutil.copy("jaimin.py","jaimin2.py")
# shutil.copy(src, dst): This function copies the file located at src to a new location specified by dst. If the destination location already exists, the original file will be overwritten.

# shutil.copy2("jaimin.py","jaimin2.py")
# shutil.copy2(src, dst): This function is similar to shutil.copy, but it also preserves more metadata about the original file, such as the timestamp.

# shutil.copytree("Python Codes\Code with harry/jaimin.py", "jaimin.py")
# shutil.copytree(src, dst): This function recursively copies the directory located at src to a new location specified by dst. If the destination location already exists, the original directory will be merged with it.

# shutil.move("Python Codes\Code with harry/jaimin.py", "jaimin.py")
# shutil.move(src, dst): This function moves the file located at src to a new location specified by dst. This function is equivalent to renaming a file in most cases.

# shutil.rmtree("Python Codes\Code with harry/jaimin.py")
# shutil.rmtree(path): This function recursively deletes the directory located at path, along with all of its contents. This function is similar to using the rm -rf command in a shell.
